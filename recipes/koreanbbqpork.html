  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Korean BBQ Pork is a marinated pork using a red chili paste (Gochujang) that is pan-cooked and topped with sesame seeds. It is delicious on its own but works great served over a bed of rice and a side of vegetables. </p>
    <p>A Korean BBQ is generally a group affair where friends and family come together to grill (traditionally) thin cuts of marinated meat and add a bunch of sides to the mix. Many times, the grill is at the center of attention since it is the center of the table! But, this recipe of Korean BBQ Pork doesn&apos;t have to be a group affair to be enjoyed. And, you can simply use a skillet or wok to get the flavor that is expected. It&apos;s all about the Gochujang paste and additional red pepper flakes that give it that spicy kick.</p>
