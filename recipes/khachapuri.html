  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This soft, cheese-filled bread is the national dish of the country of Georgia. Part of its charm is that it varies by region; the open-faced Adjaruli version is filled with cheese and herbs, and garnished with an egg on top. Georgians typically serve khachapuri for breakfast or enjoy it at lunch; either way, it's a traditional way to welcome friends and family to the table. Using bread flour in this recipe makes the dough easier to work with, less prone to tear, and a sturdier "nest" for its substantial filling.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h4>Dough</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons (43g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup (227g) milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar or 1 tablespoon non-diastatic malt powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon coriander</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons (9g) salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons instant yeast or active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 3/4 cups (330g) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Filling</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups (227g) mozzarella cheese or Muenster cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (113g) ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (57g) crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (14g) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 to 1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coarsely chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped chives</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Egg Wash</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 large egg beaten with 1 teaspoon water</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Garnish</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs, cold from the refrigerator</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons (19g) butter</li>
      </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>To make the dough: Heat the butter and milk together in a small saucepan or in the microwave until the butter melts.</li>
    <li>Place the sugar (or malt powder), coriander, and salt in a large bowl, and pour the hot milk over it, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Cool to lukewarm, about 100&deg;F to 110&deg;F.</li>
    <li>Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Stir in the yeast and flour, mixing until a shaggy mass forms. Cover with plastic wrap or a reusable bowl cover and let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>After the rest, knead until smooth; 8 to 10 minutes by hand, or 6 to 8 minutes at medium speed in a mixer. Knead in an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons flour if the dough is uncomfortably sticky.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until it increases in size by at least one third.</li>
    <li>To make the filling: Place all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and beat to combine, or pulse everything together briefly with a food processor; leave some bits of the cheese intact.</li>
    <li>To assemble: Line two baking sheets with parchment. Turn the risen dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into four equal pieces, about 150g each.</li>
    <li>Roll each piece into an oval shape about 10" long and 6" wide. Cover with greased plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Pull the dough's edges up around the cheese, folding and twisting the ends to form a boat shape.</li>
    <li>Cover and let rise for 20 minutes, or until puffy but not doubled. While the breads are rising, preheat the oven to 375&deg;F with two racks toward the center.</li>
    <li>Brush the exposed edges of the khachapuri with the egg wash and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until they feel set; they won't have started to brown nor will the filling be bubbly, but don't worry; they're going to continue to bake once you add their egg-and-butter garnish.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and use the back of a spoon to make an indentation about 3" across in the filling of each khachapuri. Crack an egg into each, place a teaspoon of butter on top, and bake for an additional 8 to 10 minutes (for soft-set eggs), or 12 to 15 minutes (for firmer eggs).</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and serve warm. Garnish with additional fresh herbs, if desired.</li>
    <li>Storage information: Store any leftover khachapuri, well wrapped, in the refrigerator for up to five days.</li>
  </ol>
