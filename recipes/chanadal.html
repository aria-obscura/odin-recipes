  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chana dal is a delicious, comforting, simple curry dish inspired by the traditional dal found in Indian and Pakistani dishes. The taste of dal differs by region, but the inspiration for this particular dish hails from the Indian subcontinent. <strong>Chana</strong> is chickpeas, and <strong>dal</strong> is split lentils, peas, or chickpeas. Therefore, chana dal is split chickpeas in soup or curry form! For this dish, chickpeas are split and polished, resulting in a different texture and feel than whole chickpeas (while maintaining the same health benefits).</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup dried chana dal (split chickpeas) can sub whole chickpeas*, 200 g</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil 30 ml</li>
        <li>1 white or yellow onion finely diced</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp fresh grated ginger</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>2 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>1 14.5-oz can diced tomatoes 400 g</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups water 355 mL</li>
        <li>1/4tsp salt</li>
        <li>To serve: rice, lemon, cilantro, yogurt</li>
      </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Soak: Add chana dal to a pot and cover with water. Let soak for 1 to 2 hours (or 8 hours, if starting in the morning before work). Strain before using.</li>
    <li>Base: Heat oil over medium heat in a large skillet or pot, then add onion, ginger, garlic, and garam masala. Cook until onion is softened and fragrant (about 3 minutes), then add the whole can of diced tomatoes, strained chana dal, and water.</li>
    <li>Cook: Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until chana dal is soft enough to be pinched between two fingers (about 25 to 40 minutes). Add more water, as needed, until chana dal has cooked through. Season with salt, taste, and add more salt/garam masala as needed.</li>
    <li>Serve: Serve warm with rice, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, and fresh cilantro. I also love it with a dollop of plain yogurt and some homemade naan!</li>
  </ol>
